# Ada Arithmetic Overflow Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential arithmetic overflow bug in an Ada program that adds two integer values. The bug occurs when the sum of the two integers exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in an Integer variable.  The solution implements overflow checking to handle this situation gracefully.
